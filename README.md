## Testing

Tests run in CI on push using Github actions. They are all required to pass.

### Typescript

Types are checked by running `tsc`.

### Code Style

We are enforcing code styles using eslint, prettier and stylelint.

### Visual Regression Tests

Visual regressions tests are run by snapshoting storybooks and running diffs against the previous
baseline and the new snapshots. A unique story is required to test visual regressions on different
prop variations.

If regressions are detected or a new story is added on a PR a review is required after the last
commit is pushed. If a new commit is pushed after the PR is approved, it will reset the approval for
the new baseline and a new review will be required in order for it to be accepted.
