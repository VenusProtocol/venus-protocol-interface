    <h2>10. Technology and Protocol Risks</h2>

    <p>
      You acknowledge and accept substantial risks inherent in decentralized protocols and smart
      contracts, including but not limited to:
    </p>

    <h3>10.1 Smart Contract Risks</h3>

    <p>
      Software vulnerabilities, exploits, bugs, unexpected behaviors, and potential economic attacks
      on protocol mechanisms.
    </p>

    <h3>10.2 Infrastructure Risks</h3>

    <p>
      Blockchain network congestion, hard forks, validator failures, and potential network splits or
      reorganizations.
    </p>

    <h3>10.3 Oracle and Price Feed Risks</h3>

    <p>
      Reliance on external price oracles that may be manipulated, delayed, or provide inaccurate
      data, potentially affecting liquidations and protocol operations.
    </p>

    <h3>10.4 Governance Risks</h3>

    <p>
      Changes to protocol parameters through governance mechanisms that may adversely affect your
      positions or the protocol's operation.
    </p>

    <h3>10.5 Interoperability Risks</h3>

    <p>Risks arising from interactions with other protocols, bridges, or cross-chain mechanisms.</p>

    <p className="font-semibold text-offWhite">

    </p>

    <h2>11. Market, Volatility, and Liquidation Risks</h2>

    <h3>11.1 Market Volatility</h3>

    <p>
      Digital assets and stablecoins are inherently volatile and may experience rapid and
      substantial price fluctuations.
    </p>

    <h3>11.2 Liquidation Mechanics</h3>

    <p>
      You understand that positions may be liquidated automatically when collateral ratios fall
      below required thresholds, potentially resulting in partial or total loss of collateral.
    </p>

    <h3>11.3 Slippage and MEV</h3>

    <p>
      Transactions may be subject to slippage, front-running, or maximum extractable value (MEV)
      extraction by third parties.
    </p>

    <h3>11.4 Stablecoin Risks</h3>

    <p>
      Synthetic stablecoins may depeg from their intended value due to market conditions, protocol
      mechanics, or external factors.
    </p>

    <h3>11.5 Impermanent Loss</h3>

    <p>Certain activities may expose you to impermanent loss or other opportunity costs.</p>

    <p>
      You are solely responsible for monitoring your positions, understanding protocol mechanics,
      and managing risk exposure at all times.
    </p>

    <h2>12. Regulatory Uncertainty</h2>

    <p>
      The legal and regulatory environment for decentralized protocols and digital assets is

    <p>
      Some aspects of the Platform may be governed or influenced by decentralized autonomous
      organization ("DAO") mechanisms and on-chain community proposals. Outcomes of protocol
      governance or DAO proposals are not controlled by Venus Protocol and are implemented
      automatically via smart contracts.
    </p>

      collection and use.
    </p>
