## About Dogecoin
Dogecoin (DOGE) is based on the popular \\"doge\\" Internet meme and features a Shiba Inu on its logo. The open-source digital currency was created by [Billy Markus](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/article/dogecoin-a-stunning-surge-a-crushing-blow-a-surprise-comeback) from Portland, Oregon and Jackson Palmer from Sydney, Australia, and was forked from Litecoin in December 2013. Dogecoin's creators envisaged it as a fun, light-hearted cryptocurrency that would have greater appeal beyond the core Bitcoin audience, since it was based on a dog meme. Tesla CEO Elon Musk posted several tweets on social media that Dogecoin is his favorite coin.

## Summary
Increase the borrow factors from 60% to 80% for selected big caps and stable coins. While markets are highly volatile and market swings happen in both directions, these assets have sufficient liquidity, volume, and markets available for liquidators to be compensated for their work. There have been millions of liquidations properly executed on-chain by liquidators, thus, these changes do not pose a systematic risk. Rather, these changes improve Venus’s competitive advantage while still being over-collateralized.

Update speed setting for Doge and Bitcoin Cash to 50 XVS daily.

Proposal:
- BTCB 60% to 80%
- ETH 60% to 80%
- BNB 60% to 80%
- XVS 60% 80%
- SXP 60% to 80%
- USDT 60% to 80%
- BUSD 60% to 80%
- USDC 60% to 80%

- Doge: Decrease speed setting from 119.99 to 50 XVS daily
- BCH: Increase speed setting from 18.32 to 50 XVS daily

By increasing the above asset collateral to 80%, which will allow users to utilize the higher borrow factors on their existing positions or receive more security for their open positions.

## About Dogecoin
Dogecoin (DOGE) is based on the popular \\"doge\\" Internet meme and features a Shiba Inu on its logo. The open-source digital currency was created by [Billy Markus](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/article/dogecoin-a-stunning-surge-a-crushing-blow-a-surprise-comeback) from Portland, Oregon and Jackson Palmer from Sydney, Australia, and was forked from Litecoin in December 2013. Dogecoin's creators envisaged it as a fun, light-hearted cryptocurrency that would have greater appeal beyond the core Bitcoin audience, since it was based on a dog meme. Tesla CEO Elon Musk posted several tweets on social media that Dogecoin is his favorite coin.

## Summary
Increase the borrow factors from 60% to 80% for selected big caps and stable coins. While markets are highly volatile and market swings happen in both directions, these assets have sufficient liquidity, volume, and markets available for liquidators to be compensated for their work. There have been millions of liquidations properly executed on-chain by liquidators, thus, these changes do not pose a systematic risk. Rather, these changes improve Venus’s competitive advantage while still being over-collateralized.

Update speed setting for Doge and Bitcoin Cash to 50 XVS daily.

Proposal:
- BTCB 60% to 80%
- ETH 60% to 80%
- BNB 60% to 80%
- XVS 60% 80%
- SXP 60% to 80%
- USDT 60% to 80%
- BUSD 60% to 80%
- USDC 60% to 80%

- Doge: Decrease speed setting from 119.99 to 50 XVS daily
- BCH: Increase speed setting from 18.32 to 50 XVS daily

By increasing the above asset collateral to 80%, which will allow users to utilize the higher borrow factors on their existing positions or receive more security for their open positions.

Liquidators play a key role in securing the platform by performing liquidations when users have gone over their borrowing limit. This liquidation process guarantees that all assets borrowed by Venus are 100% backed by supplied collateral.
